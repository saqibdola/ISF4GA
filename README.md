# In-Silico-Framework-for-Genome-Analysis

## The framework contains three main methods to analyze genomes in (1) nucleotide form, (2) coding region form and (3) protein form. 

## The first method finds nucleotides changes in whole genomes. The second method can be used to find the nucleotides changes, including the changes due to synonymous codons, in the whole genomes as well as in different genes in the genomes. The third method can find amino acid changes in the genomes and its various genes. 

### The framework can also be used to find the overall composition of nucleotide bases and amino acids, GC and AT/GC contents, and the codon base com-
position in the whole genomes as well as in different genes.
